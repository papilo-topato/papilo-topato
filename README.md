## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am an **Electronics & Communication Engineer** transformed into a **Software Solutions Architect**.

Most recently, I worked as a **Management Trainee (Tech & Innovation)** at **EPS**, where I bridged the gap between business strategy and hands-on coding. I don't just write scripts; I build systems that scale. From automating workflows for **13,000+ ATMs** to building Financial Intelligence engines, I focus on impact.
